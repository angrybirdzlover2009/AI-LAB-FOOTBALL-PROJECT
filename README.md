From this video, we will split the job like this:
  - Mihnea: Use ultralytics and YOLOv8 to detect objects in images and videos.
    Fine tune and train your own YOLO on your own custom dataset.
  - Jasch: Measure player's speed and distance covered in the image. 

  - Petar: Use KMeans to cluster pixles and segment players from the background to get the t-shirt color accurately. 
    Use optical flow to measure the camera movement. 
  - Relja: Use CV2's (opencv) perspective transformation to represent the scene's depth and perspective.
    Use optical flow to measure the camera movement.
  - Finish until Sunday (23/05/2024). Bring also some points about what you did for the presentation
